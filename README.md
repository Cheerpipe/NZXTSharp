# NZXTSharp

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/nzxtsharp/badge/?version=latest)](https://nzxtsharp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20-Discord%20Server-blue.svg)](https://discord.gg/yK8m2CU)

NZXTSharp is a C# package that allows interaction with NZXT's Hue+. Support for other devices will be coming.

Find NZXTSharp on NuGet [here][0]. If you are adding through Visual Studio, please be sure to check `Include Prereleases`.

**Please keep in mind that NZXTSharp is in heavy development, and will have breaking changes in the future.**
<br>**NZXTSharp is in very early development, and very little is supported at the moment. Please keep checking back!**

Documentation is still a work in progress, and can be found at [NZXTSharp's readthedocs.io page][3]. Docs are built from [the docs branch][4].

### Syntax
NZXTSharp's syntax is lightweight, only taking a few lines to get started.

```C#
using NZXTSharp;
using NZXTSharp.Devices;
using NZXTSharp.Effects;

HuePlus hue = new HuePlus(); // Create device
Fixed effect = new Fixed(new Color(255, 255, 255)); // Make fixed effect
hue.ApplyEffect(hue.Both, effect); // Apply effect
```

### FAQ

**Q:** Are there any plans to make an SDK in XX language?
<br>**A:** As of yet, no. I am focusing on support for the .NET framework. Python is most likely next.

**Q:** Is XX device supported? 
<br>**A:** Right now, I am working on support for the Hue+. Once that is complete, I plan to move into the Krakens and the Hue 2.
