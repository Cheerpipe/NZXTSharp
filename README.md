NZXTSharp is a C# package that allows interaction with NZXT hardware.

You can find NZXTSharp on NuGet [here][0].

**I am looking for people to help NZXTSharp grow by integrating NZXTSharp with [ProjectAurora][5] and/ or [RGB.NET][6]. If you are interested, please contact me on [Discord][7], or by email.**

## Syntax
NZXTSharp's syntax is lightweight, only taking a few lines to get started.

```C#
using NZXTSharp;
using NZXTSharp.HuePlus;

HuePlus hue = new HuePlus(); // Create device
Fixed effect = new Fixed(new Color(255, 255, 255)); // Make fixed effect
hue.ApplyEffect(hue.Both, effect); // Apply effect
```

## FAQ

**Q:** Are there any plans to make an SDK in XX language?
<br>**A:** As of yet, no. I am focusing on support for the .NET Framework. Python or C++ is most likely next.

**Q:** Is XX device supported? 
<br>**A:** The Hue+ is fully supported, the KrakenX is a WIP, and the Hue 2 or the Grid v3 is most likely next.

## Documentation
