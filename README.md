# NZXTSharp

NZXTSharp is a C# package that allows interaction with NZXT's Hue+. Support for other devices will be coming.

Find NZXTSharp on NuGet [here][0]. If you are adding through Visual Studio, please be sure to check `Include Prereleases`.

**Please keep in mind that NZXTSharp is in heavy development, and will have breaking changes in the future.**
<br>**If a device you want is not supported yet, please [submit an issue][1] with the `device-request` label.**
<br>**NZXTSharp is in very early development, and very little is supported at the moment. Please keep checking back!**

### Syntax
NZXTSharp's syntax is lightweight, only taking a few lines to get started.

```C#
using NZXTSharp;
using NZXTSharp.Devices;
using NZXTSharp.Effects;

HuePlus hue = new HuePlus(); // Create device
Fixed effect = new Fixed(new HexColor(255, 255, 255)); // Make fixed effect
hue.ApplyEffect(hue.Both, effect); // Apply effect
```
