# NZXTSharp : NZXTDeviceProvider for RGB.NET

[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20-Discord%20Server-blue.svg)](https://discord.gg/yK8m2CU)

This is the branch for the RGB.NET NZXT Device Provider. It is still a work in progress, and is not working at all. It is based heavily on the RGB.NET Corsair Device Provider.

The NZXT Device Provider works with NZXTSharp to provide the SDK's functionality to [RGB.NET][0]. 

Some functionality available in NZXTSharp may be unavailable in the NZXT Device Provider because of how RGB.NET works, but I will do my best to provide all functionality available in the SDK.

**Features in the NZXTSharp SDK may not be available in the device provider.**

**Any feature or device NOT supported in NZXTSharp WILL NOT be supported in the device provider.**
