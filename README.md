# NZXTSharp Docs Branch

This branch is a WIP, but will soon contain the most current docs on NZXTSharp, which can be found at [NZXTSharp's docfx page][0].
I am currently working on migrating all docs over from NZXTSharp's readthedocs.io page.

Thank you to [Fanman03][1] for providing free docs hosting!

There are also some powershell scripts I use when working with VS Code in the Scripts dir.
