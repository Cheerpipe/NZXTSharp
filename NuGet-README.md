NZXTSharp is the one-stop C# SDK for NZXT hardware.

Documentation can be found at [NZXTSharp's readthedocs.io page][3]. Docs are built from [the docs branch][4].
There are also XML docs in the source.

**I am looking for people to help NZXTSharp grow by integrating NZXTSharp with [ProjectAurora][5] and/ or [RGB.NET][6]. If you are interested, please contact me on [Discord][7], or by email.**
