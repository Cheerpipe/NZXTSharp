NZXTSharp is for the NZXT community. I hope that it will be used not just by devs, but that those devs will use NZXTSharp to build
applications that many people (even with no dev experience) can use. Because of this, I believe that any and all awareness of NZXT SDKs
will be beneficial to the community. Listing of an SDK is not an endorsement.

If I missed your SDK, please contact me! My contact info can be found on the support page.
